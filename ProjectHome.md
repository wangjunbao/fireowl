# Abstract #

By reading the contents of a web page, we generally identify its subject without great difficulty due to our natural intelligence. Furthermore, computers do not easily identify the subject of the page it is showing due to characteristics and limitations of the technology used to display such content.

With the rise of new technologies and efforts to transform the "web of unstructured documents" on "web data", it becomes possible to combine new and traditional technologies in order to give more intelligence to computers and help your users.

The purpose of this project is to create an agent capable of identifying the subject of the main content of the page being displayed in the browser and display a complementary content related to the subject, using techniques and tools of the semantic web.
